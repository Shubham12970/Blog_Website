          <h2 class="post-title">Stock Price Prediction </h2>
          <p>The Stock Price Prediction project is designed specifically to predict the future stock prices of Tesla
              based on historical data and market trends. Using advanced machine learning techniques such as regression
              models, time series analysis, and deep learning algorithms, the system analyzes Tesla's historical stock
              data, trading volumes, and other financial indicators to forecast potential price movements.</p>
          <p>By incorporating factors like economic conditions, company performance, industry trends, and even
              sentiment analysis of news related to Tesla, the model generates predictions for Tesla’s stock price in
              the short and long term. The machine learning model is trained on large datasets, continuously refined
              with real-time data, and evaluated for accuracy to provide reliable predictions.</p>
          <p>This project serves as a valuable tool for Tesla investors, providing insights into future stock price
              fluctuations and helping them make more informed decisions. With its ability to focus specifically on
              Tesla, the system tailors its predictions to the unique characteristics of Tesla’s stock performance,
              offering more precise forecasts for those interested in trading or investing in the company.</p>
          <h4><u>Tech Stack:</u></h4>
          <p>The Stock Price Prediction project utilizes a range of technologies to efficiently analyze data, create
              predictions, and visualize results. <b>Jupyter Notebook</b> serves as the development environment, allowing
              for interactive coding, testing, and documentation all in one place. For data processing, <b>Pandas</b>
              is used to clean and structure the stock price data, making it easy to handle time-series information
              and perform necessary transformations. <b>NumPy</b> is employed for numerical operations, particularly
              with large datasets, allowing for high-performance calculations needed for machine learning.</p>
          <p>To visualize trends and relationships in the data, <b>Matplotlib</b> and <b>Seaborn</b> are used.
              <b>Matplotlib</b> creates basic visualizations like line graphs, while <b>Seaborn</b> offers advanced
              statistical charts such as heatmaps and distribution plots, which help in exploring data patterns.
              Finally, <b>ML Regression</b> algorithms are utilized to predict Tesla’s stock price, analyzing
              historical data and identifying patterns to forecast future price movements with accuracy.</p>
          <br>
          <p>In this project, I first plots all different price charts and moving averages of the price on 7-day,
              1-month, 3-months and 6-months basis. I also used four different algorithms to predict the price of the
              stock. These four algorithms are : <i>Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boosting
                  Regressor</i> and <i>Support Vector Machine(SVM)</i>.</p>
          <p>I then, compared the different predictions and found that the <i>Random Forest Regressor(RFR) Model</i> prediction
              had the least difference between the actual and predicted price whereas <i>Linear Regression Model</i>
              had the most.</p>

          <h2 class="post-title"> Microcontroller-Based Power Line Fault Detection </h2>
          <p>This project involves developing a microcontroller-based system for detecting faults in power lines,
              aiming to enhance reliability, safety, and efficiency within electrical distribution networks. The
              system leverages various sensors to continuously monitor electrical parameters, including voltage,
              current, and power factor, to identify and diagnose faults such as short circuits, open circuits,
              line-to-ground faults, and overloads. When a fault is detected, the microcontroller processes the
              incoming sensor data and swiftly isolates the problem area.</p>
          <p>Once a fault is identified, the system triggers an alert, which can be communicated to maintenance
              personnel through a connected interface, such as a mobile notification, SMS, or web-based dashboard.
              This real-time alert system enables quicker response times, allowing operators to address issues
              proactively and prevent widespread power outages.</p>
          <p>Moreover, the collected data can be stored and analyzed to identify trends in fault occurrences, which can
              help in preventative maintenance and infrastructure improvements. By automating fault detection and
              integrating it with communication systems, this project provides a robust and scalable solution for
              efficient power line management. The microcontroller-based design makes the system cost-effective and
              adaptable to both urban and rural power grids, contributing to smarter, more resilient electrical
              infrastructure.</p>

        <h2 class="post-title"> Smart Solar Tracker with Power Monitoring </h2>
        <p>This project is a smart solar tracking system with integrated power monitoring, designed to optimize solar
          panel performance by ensuring continuous alignment with the sun. The smart tracker uses sensors to detect
          sunlight intensity and automatically adjusts the angle of the solar panel throughout the day, capturing the
          maximum possible sunlight. This real-time adjustment boosts energy generation efficiency by up to 30%
          compared to fixed solar panels.
        </p>
        <p>
          The system includes a power monitoring feature that measures and displays energy production, usage, and
          efficiency data. Users can view real-time statistics on energy output, analyze performance trends over time,
          and detect any issues with energy generation. This allows for proactive maintenance and more effective energy
          management, as well as potential cost savings by optimizing output.
        </p>
        <p>
          By merging sustainable energy production with smart technology, this project addresses the growing need for 
          efficient renewable energy solutions. The combination of solar tracking and power monitoring provides a 
          powerful, user-friendly approach to maximizing solar energy yield while enabling data-driven energy 
          management for residential and commercial applications.
